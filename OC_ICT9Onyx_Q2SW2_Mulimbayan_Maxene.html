	<td>Golden Retriever</td>
	<td>Golden Retrievers are one of the best dogs for families. These dogs are very gentle and kind, even with children. They are known to be trustworthy, outgoing, eager-to-please family dogs, and they are relatively easy to train since they are very smart. In my opinion, Golden Retrievers are the best dogs ever. Goldens are my dream dog bread and I hope I can get one soon.</td>

	<td>Border Collie</td>
	<td>Border Collies are known to be the smartest dogs among all the dog breeds. They are highly intelligent and easy to train. Collies are like Golden Retrievers, they like being around children, and they are good family dogs!</td>

	<td>German Shepherd</td>
	<td>German Shepherds are usually common in police departments. They become the police's buddy! You may think that they are fiesty and aggressive, but in reality, they are big babies and are usually lazy. They are known to be loyal, confident, and courageous. Though you might wanna supervise them when they are playing with your children. Shepherds tend to be rough when you are playful with them.</td>

	<td>Siberian Huskies</td>
	<td>Huskies are known to be playful, friendly, and intelligent. Though, they aren't easy to train if you are a first-time dog owner. This breed was not developed to be close with the owner. They were bred for athletic abilities and endurance.</td>

	<td>Aspin/Asong Pinoy</td>
	<td>This is my dog, Cream-Oh! She is currently 10 months old and will turn 11 months on November 20. We named her "Cream-Oh" because of the biscuit, but we added an "h". Cream is an affectionate dog, and she is extremely protective of her territory. I believe that all Aspins are nice and lovable. They are not just dogs from the streets, they are also like the other dogs, the only difference is that they have a lot of mixed breeds.</td>

	<td>Dalmatian</td>
	<td>Dalmatians are highly energetic, intelligent, and sensitive dogs. These dogs are not advised to be left with children because they are too energetic and they tend to be aggressive. Dalmatians are also not good with handling small dogs, it is because they are naturally hunting animals. Though, they are still good dog breeds, you just need to supervise them when they are around with children or other dogs.</td>

	<td>Rottweiler</td>
	<td>Rottweilers are well known to be guard dogs. They are loving, loyal, and protective. With their astounding intelligence, this breed is easy to train and can be good family dogs. Yes, they do look aggressive, but they aren't! Rotts are nice and lovable, and they love making their owners laugh!</td>

	<td>Labrador Retriever</td>
	<td>Labradors are related to Golden Retrievers. They are almost alike! Labradors are high-spirited, outgoing and friendly. They make really good family dogs. Labradors are big dogs! They can weigh up to 80 pounds, and they are 24.5 inches tall.</td>

	<td><img src="https://doglime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/All-About-Norwegian-Lundehund-Dog-Breed..jpg" width="70%" height="50%"></td>
	<td>Norwegian Lundehund</td>
	<td>This breed is the rarest breed ever. They are rare because they are the only dog breed that survived in the island of Vaeroy in the 19th century. And also, they don't share the same characteristics as other breeds, Lundehungs are really unique! Despite being rare, Lundehunds are affectionate dogs, and they get along well with other dogs, children, and strangers. In my opinion, they kind of look like a fox because of the facial structure and ears. Also, a fun fact, they have six toes!</td>

	<td>Pomeranian</td>
	<td>Pomeranians are known to be smart, always curious, bold, and fiesty! In my opinion, all small dogs are quite feisty. This breed loves being the center of attention. Though, if you have small children, consider getting another dog breed. Poms are not suitable for small children. They do not like children because they don't like strangers who moves suddenly and makes lound noises.</td>
